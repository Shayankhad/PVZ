in this program we have 2 folders:
1) the src folder that contains cpp and hpp files
2) th buid folder that our make file puts the .o (object) files in it.
3) and there is a Makefile:
-----------------------------
-----------------------------

this make file make each cpp and hpp files in src(source) file to build file as a .o file and doesnt matter if we add or change cpp or hpp filles 
it still does it works.
